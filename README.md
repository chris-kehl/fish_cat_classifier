# fish_cat_classifier

This repository is from a deep learning tutorial that will detect if the object is a fish or if the object is a cat.
I referanced the book "Programming PyTorch for Deep Learning" to build this program. The download_cats_fish.ipynb was built to pull all the necessary images down from the internet and sorts them into their proper folders for taining, testin, and valiation.
